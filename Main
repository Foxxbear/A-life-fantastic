-> Is this thing on? 


honestly I don't know the angle I want to approach my career with. I have an abundance of interests, although none of them let me hone in on "I want to do the A/V industry", "I want to be in finance".
I've gone through phases and I need to lock in on actual interests so I can continue to grow myself. I feel like I haven't done anything to be a better baker, artist, musician, athlete, ect in a couple months now.
